So for each word, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process.  \\nfirst step  \\nNotice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HAVE to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant.  \\nMultiplying by the weight matrix produces , the \"query\" vector associated with that word.

They’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how attention is calculated below, you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.  \\nThe in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, “Thinking”. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position.  \\nsecond step  \\nThe score is calculated by taking the dot product of the with the of the respective word we’re scoring.

Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word.  \\nThe is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example).  \\nfifth step  \\nThe is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word).  \\nsixth step  \\nThat concludes the self-attention calculation.

This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:  \\nIt expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of every other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to.  \\nIt gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace.  \\nWith multi-headed attention, we maintain separate Q/K/V weight matrices for each head resulting in different Q/K/V matrices. As we did before, we multiply X by the WQ/WK/WV matrices to produce Q/K/V matrices.  \\nIf we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices  \\nThis leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.  \\nHow do we do that? We concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.  \\nThat’s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put them all in one visual so we can look at them in one place  \\nNow that we have touched upon attention heads, let’s revisit our example from before to see where the different attention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:  \\nAs we encode the word \"it\", one attention head is focusing most on \"the animal\", while another is focusing on \"tired\" -- in a sense, the model\\'s representation of the word \"it\" bakes in some of the representation of both \"animal\" and \"tired\".  \\nIf we add all the attention heads to the picture, however, things can be harder to interpret:'),\n",

These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention.  \\nTo give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors -- the values of which follow a specific pattern.  \\nIf we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:  \\nA real example of positional encoding with a toy embedding size of 4  \\nWhat might this pattern look like?  \\nIn the following figure, each row corresponds to a positional encoding of a vector.

You can see that it appears split in half down the center. That's because the values of the left half are generated by one function (which uses sine), and the right half is generated by another function (which uses cosine). They're then concatenated to form each of the positional encoding vectors.  \\nThe formula for positional encoding is described in the paper (section 3.5). You can see the code for generating positional encodings in . This is not the only possible method for positional encoding. It, however, gives the advantage of being able to scale to unseen lengths of sequences (e.g. if our trained model is asked to translate a sentence longer than any of those in our training set).  \\nget_timing_signal_1d()  \\nThe positional encoding shown above is from the Tensor2Tensor implementation of the Transformer.

We simply subtract one from the other. For more details, look at and .  \\ncross-entropy  \\nKullback–Leibler divergence  \\nBut note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically, we’ll use a sentence longer than one word. For example – input: “je suis étudiant” and expected output: “i am a student”. What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where:  \\nEach probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000)  \\nThe first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “i”  \\nThe second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “am”  \\nAnd so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates ‘ ’ symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary.  \\n<end of sentence>  \\nThe targeted probability distributions we'll train our model against in the training example for one sample sentence.  \\nAfter training the model for enough time on a large enough dataset, we would hope the produced probability distributions would look like this:  \\nHopefully upon training, the model would output the right translation we expect. Of course it's no real indication if this phrase was part of the training dataset (see: ). Notice that every position gets a little bit of probability even if it's unlikely to be the output of that time step -- that's a very useful property of softmax which helps the training process.  \\ncross validation  \\nNow, because the model produces the outputs one at a time, we can assume that the model is selecting the word with the highest probability from that probability distribution and throwing away the rest. That’s one way to do it (called greedy decoding). Another way to do it would be to hold on to, say, the top two words (say, ‘I’ and ‘a’ for example), then in the next step, run the model twice: once assuming the first output position was the word ‘I’, and another time assuming the first output position was the word ‘a’, and whichever version produced less error considering both positions #1 and #2 is kept. We repeat this for positions #2 and #3…etc. This method is called “beam search”, where in our example, beam_size was two (meaning that at all times, two partial hypotheses (unfinished translations) are kept in memory), and top_beams is also two (meaning we’ll return two translations). These are both hyperparameters that you can experiment with.\"),\n",
