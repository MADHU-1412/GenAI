Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstatesht, as a function of the previous hidden stateht−1 and the input for positiont. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

For each of these we use\\ndk =dv =dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to−∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW 1 +b1)W2 +b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndf f = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimensiondmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,z i∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations.

This would increase the maximum\\npath length toO(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel widthk<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack ofO(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, toO(k·n·d +n·d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] withβ1 = 0.9,β2 = 0.98 andϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel· min(step_num−0.5,step _num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrstwarmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'),\n",

Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout ratePdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penaltyα = 0.6 [31]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\n9'),\n",

       "'We are living in one of the most important technological moments in human history. For the first time, machines are not only helping us calculate numbers or store information, but they are beginning to understand language, generate ideas, and create content that feels human-like. This transformation is being driven by Large Language Models and Generative Artificial Intelligence, commonly known as LLMs and GenAI. These technologies are reshaping education, healthcare, business, creativity, and the future of work itself.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence did not appear suddenly. It evolved slowly over decades. In the beginning, computers followed fixed rules written by programmers. If a condition was met, the machine performed a specific action. This was useful but limited. Later, machine learning allowed systems to learn from data instead of rules. Then deep learning introduced neural networks inspired by the human brain, enabling computers to recognize images, understand speech, and detect patterns. Now we have reached the generative era, where machines are not just analyzing existing information but creating new content. This is a fundamental shift in what technology can do.\\n\\nLarge Language Models are the core of this revolution. These models are trained on massive amounts of text from books, websites, research papers, conversations, and articles. They learn how words relate to each other, how sentences are structured, and how meaning flows in language. Instead of memorizing facts like a database, they learn patterns. When given a prompt, they predict the most likely next words based on everything they have learned. This allows them to answer questions, write essays, summarize documents, translate languages, generate computer code, and hold realistic conversations.\\n\\nGenerative AI goes beyond language. It includes systems that can create images, videos, music, designs, and even virtual worlds. An artist can describe a scene, and AI can generate a realistic painting. A musician can hum a tune, and AI can produce a full song. A business can describe a logo idea, and AI can design multiple versions instantly. Creativity, once limited by time and skill, is now amplified by technology.\\n\\nThe impact of these technologies is already visible across industries. In healthcare, AI helps doctors analyze medical scans, detect diseases earlier, predict patient risks, and personalize treatments. In education, AI tutors explain complex topics in simple language, adapt lessons to individual learning styles, and provide 24-hour support to students around the world. In business, AI automates customer service, generates marketing content, analyzes large datasets, and improves decision-making. In software development, AI writes code, tests applications, and fixes bugs faster than ever before.\\n\\nGenerative AI is also transforming scientific research. Scientists use AI to analyze massive amounts of data in fields like genetics, climate science, and physics. It accelerates drug discovery, helping researchers identify potential medicines in weeks instead of years. It helps model climate change scenarios, allowing governments to plan better environmental policies. AI is becoming a powerful partner in solving some of humanity’s biggest challenges.\\n\\nHowever, with such power come serious concerns. One major risk is misinformation. AI can generate fake news articles, false images, and realistic videos that are difficult to distinguish from real ones. This can spread confusion, manipulate public opinion, and damage trust in information. Another concern is bias. Since AI learns from human-created data, it can absorb and repeat existing social biases related to gender, race, or culture. Privacy is also a critical issue, as large datasets often include sensitive information.\\n\\nJob displacement is another fear many people have. Automation may replace certain repetitive tasks in industries such as manufacturing, customer support, and data entry. But history shows that technological revolutions usually change jobs rather than eliminate them entirely. When computers were introduced, many feared the end of employment. Instead, new careers emerged in IT, software development, digital marketing, and data science. Similarly, AI will create new roles such as AI trainers, ethicists, prompt engineers, and human-AI collaboration specialists.\\n\\nThe future workforce will focus more on skills that machines struggle to replicate: creativity, emotional intelligence, critical thinking, leadership, and complex problem solving. AI will handle routine tasks, while humans will concentrate on innovation and strategy. In this way, AI becomes an assistant rather than a replacement.\\n\\nEthics will play a central role in shaping the future of AI. Developers and governments must ensure transparency in how AI systems make decisions. There must be accountability when AI causes harm. Fairness must be built into algorithms to avoid discrimination. Most importantly, humans must remain in control of critical decisions, especially in areas like healthcare, law enforcement, and national security.\\n\\nEducation systems must also evolve to prepare students for an AI-driven world. Learning should focus not only on memorizing information but on understanding concepts, thinking creatively, and using technology responsibly. AI literacy will become as essential as reading and writing. Students who understand how AI works will be better equipped to use it effectively and ethically.\\n\\nThe relationship between humans and AI should not be seen as a competition. It should be viewed as a collaboration. Humans bring emotion, purpose, values, and imagination. AI brings speed, accuracy, and the ability to process enormous amounts of information. Together, they form a powerful combination capable of achieving things neither could accomplish alone.\\n\\nLooking ahead, we can imagine a world where personalized AI doctors monitor our health in real time, preventing diseases before symptoms appear. AI teachers could provide customized education to every child regardless of location or income. Smart cities could use AI to manage traffic, energy consumption, waste, and public safety efficiently. Scientific discoveries could happen at unprecedented speeds, unlocking solutions to climate change, hunger, and disease.\\n\\nBut this future is not guaranteed to be positive by default. It depends on the choices we make today. If AI is developed responsibly, inclusively, and ethically, it can become one of the greatest tools for human progress. If misused or controlled by a few without oversight, it could deepen inequality and create serious risks.\\n\\nTherefore, our responsibility is clear. We must guide AI with human values. We must ensure it benefits all of society, not just a small group. We must remain curious, critical, and informed about how it works and how it is used.\\n\\nLarge Language Models and Generative AI represent a new chapter in the story of human innovation. Just as the printing press spread knowledge, electricity transformed industry, and the internet connected the world, AI is reshaping intelligence itself. It is expanding what is possible in ways we are only beginning to understand.\\n\\nRather than fearing this transformation, we should embrace it with wisdom. We should learn how to work alongside intelligent machines. We should use them to solve real-world problems, enhance creativity, and improve quality of life. The goal is not to build machines that replace humans, but to build tools that help humans reach their full potential.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Generative AI and Large Language Models are not just technological advancements; they are powerful forces shaping the future of society. They are changing how we learn, work, create, and communicate. They hold immense promise as well as serious responsibility. If guided correctly, they can lead us toward a world of greater knowledge, efficiency, creativity, and opportunity.\\n\\nThe future will not belong to AI alone.\\nIt will belong to humans who understand AI, guide AI, and use AI wisely.\\n\\nAnd that future begins now.\\n'"
