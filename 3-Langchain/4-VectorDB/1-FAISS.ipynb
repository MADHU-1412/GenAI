These models are trained on massive amounts of text from books, websites, research papers, conversations, and articles. They learn how words relate to each other, how sentences are structured, and how meaning flows in language. Instead of memorizing facts like a database, they learn patterns. When given a prompt, they predict the most likely next words based on everything they have learned. This allows them to answer questions, write essays, summarize documents, translate languages, generate computer code, and hold realistic conversations.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='The impact of these technologies is already visible across industries. In healthcare, AI helps doctors analyze medical scans, detect diseases earlier, predict patient risks, and personalize treatments. In education, AI tutors explain complex topics in simple language, adapt lessons to individual learning styles, and provide 24-hour support to students around the world. In business, AI automates customer service, generates marketing content, analyzes large datasets, and improves decision-making. In software development, AI writes code, tests applications, and fixes bugs faster than ever before.'),\n",

Scientists use AI to analyze massive amounts of data in fields like genetics, climate science, and physics. It accelerates drug discovery, helping researchers identify potential medicines in weeks instead of years. It helps model climate change scenarios, allowing governments to plan better environmental policies. AI is becoming a powerful partner in solving some of humanity’s biggest challenges.\\n\\nHowever, with such power come serious concerns. One major risk is misinformation. AI can generate fake news articles, false images, and realistic videos that are difficult to distinguish from real ones. This can spread confusion, manipulate public opinion, and damage trust in information. Another concern is bias. Since AI learns from human-created data, it can absorb and repeat existing social biases related to gender, race, or culture. Privacy is also a critical issue, as large datasets often include sensitive information.'),\n",

Automation may replace certain repetitive tasks in industries such as manufacturing, customer support, and data entry. But history shows that technological revolutions usually change jobs rather than eliminate them entirely. When computers were introduced, many feared the end of employment. Instead, new careers emerged in IT, software development, digital marketing, and data science. Similarly, AI will create new roles such as AI trainers, ethicists, prompt engineers, and human-AI collaboration specialists.\\n\\nThe future workforce will focus more on skills that machines struggle to replicate: creativity, emotional intelligence, critical thinking, leadership, and complex problem solving. AI will handle routine tasks, while humans will concentrate on innovation and strategy. In this way, AI becomes an assistant rather than a replacement.'),\n",

Developers and governments must ensure transparency in how AI systems make decisions. There must be accountability when AI causes harm. Fairness must be built into algorithms to avoid discrimination. Most importantly, humans must remain in control of critical decisions, especially in areas like healthcare, law enforcement, and national security.\\n\\nEducation systems must also evolve to prepare students for an AI-driven world. Learning should focus not only on memorizing information but on understanding concepts, thinking creatively, and using technology responsibly. AI literacy will become as essential as reading and writing. Students who understand how AI works will be better equipped to use it effectively and ethically.'),\n",

AI teachers could provide customized education to every child regardless of location or income. Smart cities could use AI to manage traffic, energy consumption, waste, and public safety efficiently. Scientific discoveries could happen at unprecedented speeds, unlocking solutions to climate change, hunger, and disease.'),\n",
