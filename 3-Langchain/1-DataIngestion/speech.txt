Large Language Models, or LLMs, are advanced AI systems that understand and generate human-like text.
They are trained on massive amounts of data to answer questions, write content, and solve problems.
LLMs power tools like chatbots, translators, and coding assistants we use every day.
They are transforming education, healthcare, and business through automation and intelligence.
In the future, LLMs will play a major role in how humans interact with technology.
